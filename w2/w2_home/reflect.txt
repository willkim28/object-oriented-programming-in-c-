1.
-Arrays are stored in consecutive memory
-The memory following immediately after the array may be allocated for something else
-When increasing the size of an array, the new memory allocation may conflict with the existing ones

2.
-Being a static array, and not a dynamically allocated array, the programmer does not need to be responsible for the deallocation
-The compiler will deallocate the array automatically upon runtime end

3.
-The compiler preserves function signature through a mix of its identifier/parameter types/parameter order (mangling)
-Upon function call, the compiler will try to match the three constituents of the signatures
-Copmiler will only fail to call the correct function when the signature is ambiguous (returns error)

4.
-Function overloading implementation
-Usage of pointers to allocate/deallocate dynamic memory
-Continuation of ws1, endl != end1

Quiz 1 Reflection:
1. What is the one definition rule?
-One definition rule means a definition may only appear once within its SCOPE

3. With respect to scope, what is shadowing?
-Identifier declared with an inner scope can shadow an identifier declared with a broader scope, making the latter temporarily inaccessible (variable gets "shadowed")
