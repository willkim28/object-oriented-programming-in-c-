1. Why does the copy assignment operator check for self-assignment before doing anything else?
-If we neglect to check for self assignment, the deallocation statement would release the memory holding the resource data and we would lose access to the source resource.

2. List examples of how you avoided code duplication.
-isValid() function to check validity

3. List what you have learned in completing this workshop.
-usage of copy constructors
-fluency of allocating dynamic array
