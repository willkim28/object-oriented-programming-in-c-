1. What happens if you try to put your templated functions in Data.cpp? Does your source code compile if you move all functions to Data.h? Explain.

The compiler will throw an error unless the template code is explicitly instantiated in the cpp.

2. Move one templated function into ws9_lab.cpp. Does it work now? Do you need to define the template function above main(), before it is used, or can you define it below main()?
No, the max() function is not found.

3. Could you have done this lab without templates, by just overloading your functions in Data.h to accept integer and double arguments? What is the advantage of using templates?
Yes, but it would not have allowed for a more functional code using the T type variable. By implementing templates, the code was cleaner to read.

4. Are the following equivalent?
template<class T>

template<typename T>
Yes
